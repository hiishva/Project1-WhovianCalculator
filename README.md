# Project1-WhovianCalculator
Problem: Somewhere in the time stream, the TARDIS picked up a nasty techno-virus from the Daleks
and has become infected. Because of this, the computers onboard the TARDIS are not able to perform
the calculations necessary to navigate. Doctor Who must manually enter the calculations into the
TARDIS interface until the virus can be “exterminate”d. These calculations involve real, imaginary and
complex numbers. As the Doctor’s handy apprentice, you have been asked to create a program that will
perform these calculations so that the Doctor can quickly enter the information for the TARDIS.
